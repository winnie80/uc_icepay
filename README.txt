ICEPAY postbacks
From the moment you initiate an online payment, ICEPAY will produce postbacks and post them to your website. These postbacks contain valuable information indicating whether your payment is:

OK – Payment has been completed successfully.
Open – Payment has not yet been completed. You will receive another postback in the near future, which will tell you if the payment has been completed or has expired.
Error – Payment failed, expired or manually cancelled by the end-user.
Refunded – The request refund of the payment has been processed successfully.
Charged back – A charge back for the payment has been requested by the end-user.
